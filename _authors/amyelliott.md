bio: "My name is Amy, and I'm a gameplay programmer and artist from the UK. I've published my first game on the Google Playstore when I was 17, and I'm currently a first-year student at the University of Portsmouth studying Computer Games Technology BSc (Hons), as well as doing Commission Artwork and working retail. I've recently graduated from Northbrook Metropolitan College with a Disctinction grade, studying Creative Media Technology (Games Development). I love learning new skills and taking on challenges, I achieve this by working hard and doing lots of self-directed study in hopes to have T shaped knowledge"
